    name: 'Midnight Mass',
    platform: 'Netflix',
    description: 'If you enjoyed Haunting of Hill House, or Hush, or Geralds Game, or any other of Mike Flannigans work, watch this. I do not want to talk about it too much, but check it out.'

    name: 'Scenes From A Marriage',
    platform: 'Sky',
    description: 'Based on the movie/tv series by Ingmar Bergman. It starrs the best looking people in Hollywood, Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain, who undergo some marital trouble. It is just so perfectly made, and also pretty hard-hitting, emotionally speaking.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Atlanta',
    platform: 'Disney+',
    description: 'Created by, written and starring Donald Glover, so if you´re a fan of him, you gotta see this. It is about an up-and-coming rapper in Atlanta, the episodes are short and funny and just fly by.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Mythic Quest',
    platform: 'Apple TV+',
    description: 'The first show to go from my watchlist to my recommendations. It is a workplace comedy about game developers. And it starrs Danny Pudi, aka Abed from Community. I appreciate how close to real software development they try to be, it is engaging and the characters are fun.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Schitt´s Creek',
    platform: 'Amazon',
    description: 'Very recently watched this, but on american Netflix. Now it is on Amazon and it is very refreshing and funny and heart-warming and deserves all the attention it got. It is about a rich family stranded in a small town after their lives fall apart.',

  {
    name: 'Baskets',
    platform: 'Disney+',
    description: 'The latest show that I find very funny. I cannot recommend it enough, the performance of the mother is one of the most unique things I have seen. It is about a clown in a mid-life crisis who has to move back in with his mother in Bakersfield, California. It has a lot of laugh-out-loud moments but is also very personal and heartfelt.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Feel Good',
    platform: 'Netflix',
    description: 'This is basically a movie. Six episodes, 25 minutes each. So it is perfect for the weekend. Because it is so short I kind of don´t want to say anything else about it, just put it on your watch list.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Veep',
    platform: 'Sky',
    description: 'Very funny if you pay attention. Otherwise you would probably think this is just a boring political sitcom. But it is incredibly well written and has had a huge impact on pop culture in the US.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Crashing',
    platform: 'Netflix',
    description: 'If you want to see more by Phoebe Waller-Bridge after you finished Fleabag. This is not quite as good as Fleabag, and it is only one season.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Community',
    platform: 'Netflix',
    description: 'From Rick and Morty co-creator Dan Harmon. It has so many clever pop culture references, meta humor and insanely entertaining episodes. It takes a turn to the worst after season 3, but those first seasons are among my favorite TV shows.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Detroiters',
    platform: 'Amazon',
    description: 'Tim Robinson and Sam Richardson created this. I am very sad it did not go on longer than two seasons. The comedy style here is pretty different, their friendship is great and they are just fun to watch. Its about a pretty bad marketing agency.',

  },
  {
    name: 'I think you should leave',
    platform: 'Netflix',
    description: 'To me this is one of the funniest things on netflix. It is only one season with 6 episodes, and I have seen it several times. A few sketches are not as funny as the rest, but overall it is great. It is also very quotable. '
  },
  {
    name: 'Arrested Development',
    platform: 'Netflix',
    description: 'The old seasons are hilarious. If you like things like Community, or Brooklyn 99, you should try this.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Normal People',
    platform: 'Amazon',
    description: 'Get yourself a month of the Starzplay Channel and watch this. It has one minor flaw, maybe you will find out what I mean. But the love story really takes its time and is pretty well developed. The two main leads are great and I found myself rooting for them, a lot.',
    link: 'https://www.amazon.de/gp/video/detail/B08BJ3Z9ZB/ref=atv_dp_share_cu_r'
  },
  {
    name: 'Killing Eve',
    platform: 'Amazon',
    description: 'Also on the Starzplay Channel. The first season is created by Phoebe-Waller Bridge, so you kind of have to see it. It is about a assasin and the detective who is tasked to catch her. They eventually form a mutual obsession with each other.',
    link: 'https://www.amazon.de/gp/video/detail/B07NDJFJWM/ref=atv_dp_share_cu_r'

  {
    name: 'The Last Dance',
    platform: 'Netflix',
    description: 'The story behind this: The 1997 Chicago Bulls allowed a crew to film their preparations for their sixth NBA title in 8 years. This documentary series shows this footage, and more. It is just great, all the interviews, the incredible basketball moments, the fashion... The 90s are the new 80s.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Fargo',
    platform: 'Netflix',
    description: 'Maybe you should also watch the movie Fargo by the Coen Brothers first. But this stands on its own just fine. Every season of this is entirely different, but the theme remains the same: Ordinary people committing crimes. And it is pretty good.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Fleabag',
    platform: 'Amazon',
    description: 'Probably one of the most talked-about shows in recent years? Phoebe Waller-Bridge earned a bunch of emmys for it. It is just about a millenial women in London dating, dealing with her family and stuff like that. But name another show that is this creative, honest and unique. I´ll wait.',
    link: 'https://www.amazon.de/gp/video/detail/B0875Q1ZQ9/ref=atv_dp_share_cu_r'
  },
  {
    name: 'West World',
    platform: 'Amazon',
    description: 'HBO had very high hopes for Westworld after Game of Thrones ended. The first two seasons are kind of hard to wrap your brain around, but that just keeps it interesting. Its based on the film of the same name, where robots in a futuristic amusement park develop consciousness and rebel against their makers.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Mad Men',
    platform: 'Amazon',
    description: 'Also a favorite of mine. I know this will probably not be for everyone, it is probably a love it or hate it kind of show. But if you can enjoy amazing production design, paired with witty dialogues and a bunch of great fleshed out characters, you should watch this.',
    link: 'https://www.amazon.de/gp/video/detail/B08182L6M4/ref=atv_dp_share_cu_r'
  },
  {
    name: 'Handmaid´s Tale',
    platform: 'Amazon',
    description: 'Pretty grim show based on the book of the same name. You should have heard about this of course, but I recommend you check it out. It is based on the dystopian book by Margaret Atwood, in which women are degraded to bear children for their assigned masters. But it is about a lot more.',
    link: 'https://www.amazon.de/gp/video/detail/B078TLFD6Q/ref=atv_dp_share_cu_r'
  },
  {
    name: 'Master of None',
    platform: 'Netflix',
    description: 'Definitely a favorite of mine. The characters are all just so likeable, the dialogues are great and it is very honest. It is also the highest rated Netflix show on Rotten Tomatoes.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Queens Gambit',
    platform: 'Netflix',
    description: 'This is pretty entertaining and low maintenance. No commitment, just a couple of episodes, in fact it started out to become a movie. But I should give it more credit than that. The production value is impressive, and watching Anya Taylor-Joy beat Republicans at chess is great.'
  },
  {
    name: 'The Americans',
    platform: 'Netflix',
    description: 'One of my favorite shows. The world building is great, storylines are clever and is just very well constructed. You really have to pay attention though, because most things are not spelled out for you. But in my opinion it is the best spy and certainly of of the best thriller series out there.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Ozark',
    platform: 'Netflix',
    description: 'At first I thought this is just like Breaking Bad. It kind of is but it is very intense, well acted and overall very entertaining. Also, Julia Garner is in it.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Brooklyn 99',
    platform: 'Netflix',
    description: 'Again, comedy is subjective. But if you happen to like this kind of comedy, I think you will love Brooklyn 99. But I guess most people already have an opinion about it.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Breaking Bad',
    platform: 'Netflix',
    description: 'One of my all-time favorites and a must-watch. Just insanely well made and exciting.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Better Call Saul',
    platform: 'Netflix',
    description: 'I started watching this after 3 seasons or so have been released. I was skeptical because it is a spin-off of Breaking Bad, but it works on its own extremely well. I could go on about this, but this is one of those where I could not believe how entertaining it is to watch. Like Barry.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Barry',
    platform: 'Sky',
    description: 'This is just perfect television. Shorter episodes, funny, exciting, and with Bill Hader. No other show combines different tones like Barry does. One of my current favorites.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Devs',
    platform: 'Sky',
    description: 'From one of my favorite film makers, Alex Garland. So far he made one hit after the other as a director. His two movies are Ex Machina and Annihilation. This is a limited series and very engaging. It is science fiction but I still would recommend this to everyone.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Succession',
    platform: 'Sky',
    description: 'A pretty recent show, it is just in its second season and picking up emmys left and right. The family is awful, but that is the entire point. It is so funny and satirical and features dialogues which remind me a lot of Mad Men. The money stuff in it seems to be very grounded in reality as well, Slate Money even made a podcast about Succession storylines and its real world counterparts.'
  },
  {
    name: 'The Simpsons',
    platform: 'Disney+',
    description: 'Hear me out. Most peope I talk to do not know The Simpsons is owned by Disney. And I doubt that you have seen the older seasons recently. Those are among the best TV ever made.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Big Little Lies',
    platform: 'Sky',
    description: 'This one is for all the parents. I liked it too though, more so the first season. Still, this is prestige TV with an all-star cast. All the kid actors are great, and its pretty funny at times.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Catastrophe',
    platform: 'Amazon',
    description: 'An english series to shake things up a bit. I guess comedy is subjective but I find this pretty funny. The depicted releationship is unlike many others on TV, and the two protagonists wrote and created the show.',
