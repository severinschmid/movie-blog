    description: "I like a good crime story, and this reminded my a lot of No Country for Old Men, mostly because of the setting of course. It was nominated for Best Picture, and is written by Taylor Sheridan who also wrote Sicario and Wind River.",

    platform: "Netflix",
    description: "I am always interested in what Mark Duplass does, so I watched this without knowing too much else about it. It is a mostly improvised mumblecore movie, and it is deeply emotional. You should be patient with it though."

  {
    name: "Wind River",
    platform: "Netflix",
    description: "I remember seeing this in a sneak preview and being the one of my friends who liked it the most. I don´t know why anymore. But I still would recommend it. The atmosphere is great and it has a lot of emotional and intense moments. If you find Jeremy Renner off-putting, I get it. But give it a chance."

    platform: "Netflix",
    description: "Time really flew by with this one. It might be to crass for some, because most people depicted in this are horrible in some way. But there is so much great stuff about it, especially Frances McDormand who won the Academy Award for Best Lead Actress that year."

    platform: "Mubi",
    description: "Written, directed and performed by Jim Cummings. It is just impressive, Jim Cummings is extremely talented. If you are in the mood for a sweet Indie movie, this is one option. I try to feature more stuff from mubi, you should consider getting the free month trial. This spring, the first three months are just 33 cents each. Otherwise I could send you a link for a free month trial. "

    name: "The Florida Project",
    platform: "Amazon",
    description: "It is not for free on amazon, but it is on sale very often and also on the Arthouse CNMA channel. I love this, and I do not exactly know why. Maybe it is because of the main child actress Brooklyn Prince, or Willem Dafoe, or the constant swearing, or the adventure."

    name: "The Babadook",
    platform: "Amazon",
    description: "The trailer makes this look so incredibly violent but it is not. It is a horror movie though. But it is also more than that. Jennifer Kent is the writer/director, in 2019 she made The Nightingale, which is one of the most unsettling movies I have seen."
  },
  {
    name: "Us",
    platform: "Amazon",
    description: "The second movie of Jordan Peele after Get Out. Thus expectations were incredibly high, but Us still delievered. It has horror elements but I would call this more of a thriller. It is of course creepy but in the best possible way."

  {
    name: "Upgrade",
    platform: "Amazon",
    description: "Pretty good action movie. The fight scenes are fun and creative, and overall it is perfect for a rainy sunday afternoon or something."

    name: "Parasite",
    platform: "Amazon",
    description: "Again, you already know this one. It is on amazon, and it is great. Even if you watched it already, watch it again. In the original version with subtitles of course."

    platform: "Netflix",

  {
    name: "My Neighbor Totoro",
    platform: "Netflix",
    description: "Studio Ghibli is just amazing. I only saw My Neighbor Totoro recently. Despite the lack of a central protagonist, jokes, any threat or villain, a beginning or an end, this is one of the best animation movies ever made."
  },
  {
    name: "Sound of Metal",
    platform: "Amazon",
    description: "An original screenplay? Shot on film? In 2020? Even even the bar was higher you should see it. It is heart-warming, Riz Ahmed is great, and so is the entire cast."

  {
    name: "Moonrise Kingdom",
    platform: "Netflix",
    description: "A film by Wes Anderson that you have heard of but do not know is on Netflix. It is pretty sweet, features an impressive cast and is overall just nice to watch."
  },
  {
    name: "The Assistant",
    platform: "Amazon",
    description: "Even though you might have to pay for this I would recommend this to almost everyone. It takes place in what seems to be an ordinary setting, but kept me engaged the entire time. It is slow but nevertheless exciting, and it starrs Julia Garner."
  },
  {
    name: "Blackpink",
    platform: "Netflix",
    description: "A Documentary about K-Pop. I wanted to know what the hype about this genre is about, so I watched this. It is pretty informative and exposes you to a part of pop culture you might not have been exposed to otherwise."

  {
    name: "I am thinking of ending things",
    platform: "Netflix",
    description: "A weird one which is kind of hard to recommend. But if you feel that you have seen everything, go see this. I think I have to see this more times to completely get it, or to get it at all."
  },
  {
    name: "Nightcrawler",
    platform: "Netflix",
    description: "Another Jake Gyllenhaal favorite. It is pretty great, I think even one of my favorites. It is dark but nothing you cannot handle. This was also the first time I noticed Riz Ahmed and since then I kind of follow his career, too. He is also in Una, The Sisters Brothers and Sound of Metal"

  {
    name: "Incendies",
    platform: "Mubi",
    description: "The first major movie by Denis Villeneuve and the last one of him I have seen. It is mostly in french, and it is pretty grim. But it is exactly what you would expect from the director."

  {
    name: "Knives Out",
    platform: "Amazon",
    description: "Who would have thought Rian Johnson would get to make another movie after The Last Jedi. This is it, and it is a fun little Whodunit with a great cast."

  {
    name: "Super Dark Times",
    platform: "Netflix",
    description: "Pretty intense thriller. It is so low key, but it is riveting and sometimes infuriating. I remember it to look awesome, too."
  },
  {
    name: "Marriage Story",
    platform: "Netflix",
    description: "You should know this one by now. It starrs Adam Driver so of course it is going to appear here. Noah Baumbach made movies in the past that made me think of him as pretentious, but not this one. It is very good."
  },
  {
    name: "It comes at night",
    platform: "Netflix",
    description: "I can´t keep saying that movies are thrilling. I love A24, and the majority of movies they put out, this one included. The atmosphere is this is extremely well done, and the posters were amazing, too. The trailer makes it seem more like a horror movie than it acutally is, so give it chance."
  },
  {
    name: "The Sisters Brothers",
    platform: "Amazon",
    description: "Even though I rarley see Westerns, I very much enjoyed this. Starring Joaquin Phoenix, Jake Gyllenhaal, John C. Riley and Riz Ahmed."

  {
    name: "Burning",
    platform: "Amazon",
    description: "I guess this is the movie I think about the most, it is currently in my top three favorite movies. To be brief, I was just so immersed into this. The world feels so lived-in, the performances are great, and it is one of the best looking films I have ever seen. No other movie I know depicts poverty and class in South Korea like Burning. Some day I am going to make all my friends watch it."

  {
    name: "Prisoners",
    platform: "Netflix",
    description: "My favorite movie for a long time. I guess when i first saw this, no other movie has been this thrilling. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. My love for Denis Villeneuve really started with this one."
  },
  {
    name: "Arrival",
    platform: "Amazon",
    description: "You have to see this because it is from Denis Villeneuve. One of the best science fiction movies because it seems so real. The score is absolutely beautiful. Sadly, the composer Johann Johannsson died in 2018."
  },
  {
    name: "American Factory",
    platform: "Netflix",
    description: "Produced by the Obamas, this documentary won the academy award. Maybe you think you do not care about the subject matter, but I think you will still enjoy this."

    name: "Okja",
    platform: "Netflix",
    description: "You should see any movie by Bong Joon-Ho that you can find. Please still watch them in the original with subtitles. This one is on Netflix and large parts of it are in english so it is the perfect gateway."
  },
  {
    name: "Uncut Gems",
    platform: "Netflix",
    description: "Extremely anxiety inducing but also entertaining and one of the most talked about movies of 2019. This is not an Adam Sandler movie. If you enjoy it, you can also watch Good Times on Amazon, by the same directors and starring Robert Pattinson."
  },
  {
    name: "Annihilation",
    platform: "Netflix",
    description: "By one of my favorite directors, Alex Garland. He also made the limited Series Devs. Annihilation is his second film as a writer/director and I was so hyped for it after seeing Ex Machina. It definetely deliverers. Maybe too scary for some, and too boring for others, but if you like science fiction, or good movies in general, you have to see this."
  },
  {
    name: "Ex Machina",
    platform: "Amazon",
    description: "Sometimes this is not free on Amazon so you might have to spend 99 cents or something, but still. One of my favorite movies, and the directoral debut of Alex Garland, which is crazy to me."

    platform: "Disney\xa0+",
    description: "I did not have high expectations, but the Director Pete Docter also made Up and Inside Out, two Pixar movies I enjoyed. This one is fantastic, I was genuinely sad it did not come out in theaters. It made me pretty emotional and I cannot recommend it enough."
