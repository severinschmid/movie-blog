    name: "Fargo",
    platform: "Netflix",
    description: "Maybe you should also watch the movie Fargo by the Coen Brothers first. But this stands on its own just fine. Every season of this is entirely different, but the theme remains the same: Ordinary people committing crimes. And it is pretty good."
  },
  {
    name: "Fleabag",
    platform: "Amazon",
    description: "Probably one of the most talked-about shows in recent years? Phoebe Waller-Bridge earned a bunch of emmys for it. 12 episodes, 25 minutes each, for those of you who fear commitment. Name another show that is this creative, honest and unique. I´ll wait."
  },
  {
    name: "West World",
    platform: "Amazon",
    description: "HBO had very high hopes for Westworld after Game of Thrones ended. The first two seasons are kind of hard to wrap your brain around, but that just keeps it interesting."
  },
  {
    name: "Mad Men",
    platform: "Amazon",
    description: "Also a favorite of mine. I know this will probably not be for everyone, it is probably a love it or hate it kind of show. But if you can enjoy amazing production design, paired with witty dialogues and a bunch of great fleshed out characters, you should watch this."
  },
  {
    name: "Handmaid´s Tale",
    platform: "Amazon",
    description: "Pretty grim show based on the book of the same name. You should have heard about this of course, but I recommend you check it out."
  },
  {
    name: "Master of None",
    platform: "Netflix",
    description: "One of my favorite shows. The characters are all just so likeable, the dialogues are great and it is very honest. It is also the highest rated Netflix show on Rotten Tomatoes."
  },
  {
    name: "Queens Gambit",
    platform: "Netflix",
    description: "This is pretty entertaining and low maintenance. No commitment, just a couple of episodes, in fact it started out to become a movie. But I should give it more credit than that. The production value is impressive, and watching Anya Taylor-Joy beat Republicans at chess is great."
  },
  {
    name: "The Americans",
    platform: "Netflix",
    description: "One of my favorite shows. The world building is great, storylines are clever and is just very well constructed. You really have to pay attention though, because most things are not spelled out for you. But in my opinion it is the best spy and certainly of of the best thriller series out there."
  },
  {
    name: "Ozark",
    platform: "Netflix",
    description: "At first I thought this is just like Breaking Bad. It kind of is but it is very intense, well acted and overall very entertaining. Also, Julia Garner is in it."
  },
  {
    name: "Brooklyn 99",
    platform: "Netflix",
    description: "Again, comedy is subjective. But if you happen to like this kind of comedy, I think you will love Brooklyn 99. But I guess most people already have an opinion about it."
  },
  {
    name: "Breaking Bad",
    platform: "Netflix",
    description: "One of my all-time favorites and a must-watch. Just insanely well made and exciting."
  },
  {
    name: "Better Call Saul",
    platform: "Netflix",
    description: "I started watching this after 3 seasons or so have been released. I was skeptical because it is a spin-off of Breaking Bad, but it works on its own extremely well. I could go on about this, but this is one of those where I could not believe how entertaining it is to watch. Like Barry."
  },
  {
    name: "Barry",
    platform: "Sky\xa0Ticket",
    description: "This is just perfect television. Shorter episodes, funny, exciting, and with Bill Hader. No other show combines different tones like Barry does. One of my current favorites."
  },
  {
    name: "Devs",
    platform: "Sky\xa0Ticket",
    description: "From one of my favorite film makers, Alex Garland. So far he made one hit after the other as a director. His two movies are Ex Machina and Annihilation. This is a limited series and very engaging. It is science fiction but I still would recommend this to everyone."
  },
  {
    name: "Succession",
    platform: "Sky\xa0Ticket",
    description: "A pretty recent show, it is just in its second season and picking up emmys left and right. The family is awful, but that is the entire point. It is so funny and satirical and features dialogues which remind me a lot of Mad Men. The money stuff in it seems to be very grounded in reality as well, Slate Money even made a podcast about Succession storylines and its real world counterparts."
  },
  {
    name: "The Simpsons",
    platform: "Disney\xa0+",
    description: "Hear me out. Most peope I talk to about this do not know The Simpsons belongs to Disney. And I doubt that you have seen the older seasons. So go and watch them!"
  },
  {
    name: "Big Little Lies",
    platform: "Sky\xa0Ticket",
    description: "This one is for all the parents. I liked it too though, more so the first season. Still, this is prestige TV with an all-star cast. All the kid actors are great, and its pretty funny at times."
  },
  {
    name: "Catastrophe",
    platform: "Amazon",
    description: "An english series to shake things up a bit. I guess comedy is subjecitve but I find this pretty funny. The depicted releationship is unlike many others on TV, and the two protagonists wrote and created the show."
